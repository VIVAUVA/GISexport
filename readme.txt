USAGE

-ArcGIS export: call arcgisrisk with appropriate parameters, a sample prj file is included in the zip file (rename it to match the filename of your .shp and .dbf files), which specifies the North American 1983 projection standard. In order to display the graphics in a similar fashion as with Google Earth, the user must manually tweak display settings related to the data within ArcGIS (this cannot be encoded into a shapefile). Alternatively, importing the result of this function into our predefined Arcmap file (to be posted later) will automatically format the graphical display.
NOTE: Mapping Toolbox is required to run this file.


-Google Earth export: call gearthrisk with appropriate parameters. Modify sev or sevinv to change the graphic which displays as a placemark.
